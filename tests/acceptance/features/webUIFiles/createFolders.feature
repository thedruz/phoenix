Feature: create folders
  As a user
  I want to create folders
  So that I can organise my data structure

  Background:
    Given user "user1" has been created with default attributes
    And user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
    And the user has browsed to the files page

  Scenario: Create a folder inside another folder
    When the user creates a folder with the name "top-folder" using the webUI
    And the user opens folder "top-folder" using the webUI
    Then there should be no files/folders listed on the webUI
    When the user creates a folder with the name "sub-folder" using the webUI
    Then folder "sub-folder" should be listed on the webUI
    When the user reloads the current page of the webUI
    Then folder "sub-folder" should be listed on the webUI

  @skip
  Scenario: Create a folder with existing name
    When the user creates a folder with the invalid name "simple-folder" using the webUI
    Then the error message 'The resource you tried to create already exists' should be displayed on the webUI

  @skip @yetToImplement
  Scenario: Create a folder in a public share
    Given the user has created a new public link for folder "simple-empty-folder" using the webUI with
      | permission | read-write |
    And the public accesses the last created public link using the webUI
    When the user creates a folder with the name "top-folder" using the webUI
    And the user opens folder "top-folder" using the webUI
    Then there should be no files/folders listed on the webUI
    When the user creates a folder with the name "sub-folder" using the webUI
    Then folder "sub-folder" should be listed on the webUI
    When the user reloads the current page of the webUI
    Then folder "sub-folder" should be listed on the webUI
